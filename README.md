This is the repository for the Ineuron Project of predicting the sales of any individual item in a supermarket using a machine learning model, which is accessed using a web app.

Project Python File.ipynb - This is the python file in which i imported my data and trained my ML model. I trained 3 algorithms(Linear regression, Decision trees and Random forest ) and saved them on my desktop using pickle library. I then used all 3 models (in my webapp) and used the mean of the values obtained using the 3 models to get my final MRP of a store item.

Requirements.txt - This file contains all the python libraries used in the project with their versions.

App.py - Flask code for creating API for the webapp.

Setup.sh - This is the file used in deploying the webapp on heroku.

Dec_trees - Pickle file/saved model used in the project.

Lin_reg -   Pickle file/saved model used in the project.

Ran_for -   Pickle file/saved model used in the project.

Procfile - necessary file used for Heroku.

Test.csv - data set for testing the accuracy of the model in .csv format.

Train.csv - data set for training the model in .csv format.
